# Slik Samples

## About Slik 

Slik is a decentralized, encrypted file system built on top of the blockchain. Using Slik's APIs you can store data, mint NFTs, protect your data from ransomware attacks and more.


As a decentralized file system, Slik supports all the regular file operations like add, delete, update or share. You can perform these operations on the native Slik apps on web, Desktop, or mobile.
However, the Slik file system is also accessible via an API where you can perform all the above operations using the Slik SDKs.
